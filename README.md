> [!CAUTION]
> This tool modifies your save files. Make a backup your save files before using it.

This tool is designed to recover save data for offline players that have been corrupted due to leaving a guild, while maintaining the original character and guild membership. Specifically, it regenerates deleted character data in Level.sav as a level 1 initial character state. By doing this, it allows players to restore their save data while preserving their existing guild status, character customization, and equipment.
